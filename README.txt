This is a project to mimic the functionality of a Nest home surveillance camera or similar. The finished project will be able to open an attached camera and monitor the camera feed for motion. When motion is detected, the program will record a clip of the motion, marking it with a rectangle and a timestamp, and save the clip to file. If there is no motion, nothing will be recorded.

When the program does detect motion, it will text a picture of that motion to a phone number via MMS to inform the user that motion was detected.
